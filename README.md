# ToDoList

This project is a simple ToDo List application developed with Angular. It allows users to add, mark as done, and delete tasks. You can see two examples to test and apply API Conection.
It's my first project with Angular. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.

## Installation

Before running the application for the first time, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the project dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

## Development server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
ng serve --open
```
The application will open the browser and automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Or navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

To build the project for production, run:
```
npm run build-prod
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
